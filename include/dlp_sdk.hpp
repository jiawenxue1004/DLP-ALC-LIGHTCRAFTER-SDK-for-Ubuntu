/** @mainpage DLP Advanced Light Control Software Development Kit
 *
 * The DLPÂ® Advanced Light Control Software Development Kit (SDK) is a tool designed to enable faster development with
 * DLP technology platforms. The SDK includes pre-built modules that perform specialized tasks using easy
 * to understand methods. The initial goal of the SDK was to create a scaleable platform for 3D machine vision
 * applications, but is not limited to that specific application. The SDK framework is also suitable for 3D printing,
 * spectroscopy, and any other application that requires the use of DLP technology in a simple to use interface.
